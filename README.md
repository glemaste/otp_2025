# otp_2025
Architectural-level modeling of an optical tensor processor. See OTP_guide.ipynb for a description of the architecture defined within this work, as well as a guide on how to analyze its performance on CNNs. The performance of the proposed architecture is benchmarked against a reference photonic accelerator.

To get started, first follow the quick start from https://github.com/mit-emze/cimloop. Next:
```bash
#Navigate to the directory containing "docker_compose.yaml".
cd workspace/models/arch/1_macro
git clone https://github.com/glemaste/otp_2025/
```
